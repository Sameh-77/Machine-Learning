# Machine-Learning

#Assignment 1

The aim of the assignment was to get familiarize with the backpropagation algorithm which is crucial for neural network learning, and to gain hands-on experience in solving problems with this method by employing multilayer perceptrons (feed-forward networks). Moreover, to get familiarize with the basic operations and functionalities of Pytorch along with its high-level (abstract) features, and to get familiarize with the hyperparameter search (grid-search) to perform model selection.

#Assignment 2

The aim of the assignment was:

• To get familiarize with the cross-validation technique which is crucial for model tuning and model evaluation, and enable you to gain hands-on experience with it.

• To provide hands-on experience with the K Nearest Neighbor method and how to tune its hyperparameters with cross-validation.

• To get familiarize  with Kmeans and Kmeans++ algorithms at the implementation level for clustering problems and provide hands-on experience in how to pinpoint the number of clusters with the elbow method.

• To get familiarize with Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering and Silhouette method for clustering and evaluating clustering results, respectively.

#Assignmnet 3

The aim of the assignment was:
• To get familiarize with the nested cross-validation technique which is crucial for model tuning and model evaluation/comparison, and enable you to gain hands-on experience with it.

• To get familiarize with the ID3 algorithm at the implementation level.

• To get familiarize with several data preprocessing techniques that can be crucial for ML algorithms to work as expected.
